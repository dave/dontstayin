JSC compiler was developed by Arvo Sulakatko alone starting 2005 October. 

In June 2007 it was released with source-code.

JSC compiler is provided as FREEWARE, but only for private, non-commercial use, educational use.

For commercial use a partnership relation is recommended. So if you like to use this project then concact me.
