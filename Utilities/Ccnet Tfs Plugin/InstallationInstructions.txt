1) Copy the ccnet.vsts.plugin.dll assembly into the server directory for CCNET.  
2) Configure ccnet.config to referece VSTS for source control.  You will need something like this:-

		<sourcecontrol type="vsts">
		  <server>my_team_foundation_server</server>
		  <project>$/Foobar</project>
		  <workingDirectory>c:\projects\Foobar</workingDirectory>
		</sourcecontrol>

However, for full details on configuring the plug-in see http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Visual+Studio+Team+Foundation+Server+Plugin

3) Restart ccnet and enjoy.


NOTE:

To get the source to compile / run you need the following assemblies installed on the machine (If you have Team Explorer
installed on that machine then they will already be present).

Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Common.Library.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Client.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Common.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.VersionControl.Common.Integration.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.Cache.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.DataStore.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.Provision.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.QueryLanguage.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Client.RuleEngine.dll
Microsoft.TeamFoundation.WorkItemTracking.Proxy.dll

These will be in your GAC if you have the Visual Studio 2005 Team Explorer client installed on your machine
 - otherwise you'll need to copy them from one that does.  If you don't want to install the
Team Foundation Client on your build machine then you must copy the assemblies above into
the CCNET server directory along with the ccnet.vsts.plugin.dll

Good luck.
